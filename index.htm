  <p><h1>A collection of hilarious stories as introduced by Brad Schafer to his auditing students during the month of July 2015.</h1></p>
  <p>The AJC Story:</p>
  <p>So one of your audits was at the Atlanta Journal Constitution. You were doing a systems audit at the time and your job at the AJC was to go into fixed assets and see if depreciation was up to snuff as it should be. You were introduced to an older lady that took you into an office to see how she does depreciation. When you sauntered into her office your eyes detonated like a bomb as you looked at her unbelievably attention-grabbing wallpaper. Her walls were covered old school accounting style paper which was itself covered in red and black ink. To your surprise she would tell you this special wallpaper of hers was in fact her depreciation schedule. It was a nightmare. Thousands of different assets used as wallpaper. When you asked her how she knows what everything is she took out a huge list of assets and was able to find each and every asset you pointed out on that list. You would ask her about an item and she would go to the wallpaper of doom and select it for you. It was truly an amazing site to be seen. You mentioned that, to your surprise, it was actually the cleanest and most well done depreciation you had ever seen. That is a great thing to see because there was absolutely nobody checking her work. You asked her about the computer on her desk but she seemed a bit puzzled by how it worked and she definitely was not using it to keep track of depreciation. This was of course around 1994 or 1995 but there were still programs like Lotus 123 out that she could use in order to keep track of depreciation without using some sort of bizarre wallpaper system. You pointed out that despite how well all of this worked there were no internal controls at all and that if she died or retired nobody would know how anything there worked and there would be a ton of problems. You suggested (Iâ€™m not sure if this was just to us or to AJC themselves) to hire an intern to come in one year before she retired and to train that intern to use the computer and to input all of her depreciation schedules into it.</p>
